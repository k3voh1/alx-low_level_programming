# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about how to include guard in the header files and macros in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

File | Description
---------- | ----------
`0-object_like_macro.h` | header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024
`1-pi.h` | header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359
`2-main.c` | prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line
`3-function_like_macro.h` | function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x
`4-sum.h` | function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y
